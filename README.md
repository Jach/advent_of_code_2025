This was a fun advent of code, and at last one I completed all stars for! The 12-day format is better as the second half of december I'm more busy. Also helps
that this year I'm not traveling.

I'll commit the rest of the puzzle inputs in January or something.

For amusement are some included pngs. "evil shape" is the polygon from day 9 that you have to find the biggest interior rect for.
"personal times" is my own times for how long it took to solve each challenge. I looked at most of them when they dropped. The two >24h ones were at least
solved before day 11's part 2. Sleep was helpful for some of them.

None of the code here is any good, but just in case, it's released into the public domain. Unlicense if you prefer.
